### Added

- *(convert)* preserve normal textures through FBX ingestion and glTF scene round-trips, including glTF normal scale ([#222](https://github.com/mmannerm/animsmith/issues/222))

## [0.1.0](https://github.com/mmannerm/animsmith/releases/tag/v0.1.0) - 2026-07-11

### Added

- *(measure)* mesh-level measurements from SceneAssets ([#16](https://github.com/mmannerm/animsmith/pull/16))
- *(gltf)* parse meshes/skins/materials into SceneAssets ([#16](https://github.com/mmannerm/animsmith/pull/16))
- [**breaking**] fix --dry-run is the repair check mode; drop repair groups
- polish public api and release readiness
- weld converted meshes into indexed primitives and embed textures
- convert carries meshes, skins, and materials (FBX2glTF replacement)
- add transform subcommand — slice, hold-extend, gait-anchor rotation
- add fix subcommand with quat hemisphere normalization
- M2 part 2 — self-contained HTML report with WebGL skeleton viewer
- M1 — rig profiles, config, and rauta-parity semantic checks
- bootstrap animlint M0 — workspace, core model, glTF ingest, mechanical checks

### Fixed

- address writer summary review
- report converted artifact counts
- address release target audit findings
- *(examples)* make the walk fixture byte-stable across platforms
- sanitize non-finite mesh measurements; skip non-triangle prims ([#16](https://github.com/mmannerm/animsmith/pull/16))
- *(gltf)* guard mesh/skin accessor reads against count-0 panic ([#16](https://github.com/mmannerm/animsmith/pull/16))
- [**breaking**] unify SceneAssets into Document so transform keeps meshes
- compose selected repairs in fix pipeline
- honor min stride step config
- [**breaking**] reject malformed track data at load; panic-free sampling; GLB external-buffer fix writes
- treat sub-0.05 gait-phase drift as diff noise
- enforce schema_version in diff ingestion; honest FixError classification
- reject --dry-run with a write target; pin removed-flag and skip semantics
- address publishing audit findings
